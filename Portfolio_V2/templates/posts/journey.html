        It started with a CSV file—1.3 million rows of raw, messy financial transaction data.
        My first instinct was to clean it, analyze it, visualize it. But even with all my experience using Pandas and Streamlit,
        it quickly became clear: this wasn’t going to be easy. The file was too big. The Streamlit uploader kept crashing.
        The request would time out. It was frustrating.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that’s when the idea hit me: what if I could build an AI-powered tool to do this <em>for</em> the user?
        A tool that could clean, feature engineer, and explore any dataset—regardless of size. That was the spark behind what would eventually become <strong>Data Forge</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, I started small. I built a local prototype in Streamlit, integrating OpenAI’s API and LangChain to let users
        interact with their data conversationally. It worked—but only for smaller datasets. Anything over 200MB would break.
        It wasn’t enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        That question stuck with me: <strong>“How do you let users upload big data?”</strong> The answer: AWS S3.
        By decoupling the front-end from file ingestion, I could let users upload datasets—gigabytes large—into cloud storage without worrying about memory or timeouts.
        From there, the pipeline would kick off.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I went deeper: I built secure upload flows using Flask and Boto3. I spun up an EC2 instance and configured Gunicorn + systemd to keep the Flask app live.
        I designed an RDS-backed database to track user uploads. I built Lambda functions that would load files from S3,
        invoke AI cleaning agents via OpenAI and LangChain, and save the cleaned versions back.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all of that was just the backend. The frontend evolved too. I built an AI-powered visual mind map experience using Streamlit + Streamlit Flow,
        so users could visually explore their dataset by asking questions, generating plots, and uncovering insights through natural language.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, this app includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A Flask-based web UI for registration, file uploads, and dashboarding</li>
        <li>Streamlit-powered EDA visualization with AI agents</li>
        <li>S3 for file storage and ingestion</li>
        <li>RDS (MySQL) for metadata tracking</li>
        <li>AWS Secrets Manager for secure API keys</li>
        <li>OpenAI + LangChain + the <code>ai_data_science_team</code> library for automation</li>
        <li>A complete cloud-hosted deployment via EC2</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It’s not just a data dashboard. It’s a living, breathing interface between human intuition and AI automation. And honestly? It’s the proudest I’ve ever been of something I’ve built.
      </p>

        This project started months ago as a small idea. Today, it’s production-grade.

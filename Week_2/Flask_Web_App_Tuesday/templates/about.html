    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey, I’m {{ name }} — a full-stack developer, AI engineer, and courage builder. I’m passionate about designing intuitive tools that turn complexity into clarity, especially through the power of AI and data engineering. </p>

    <p>I’ve built projects like <strong>DataForge</strong>, which helps users explore and visualize datasets using natural language. I’m also actively growing through interviews, bootcamps, and personal challenges — not just to level up technically, but to become the kind of person who leads with calm, creativity, and presence.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, I’m a fan of deep conversations, spontaneous connections at coffee shops, and constantly putting myself in uncomfortable places that help me grow. Every project I build and every role I pursue is part of a bigger journey — one that’s grounded in curiosity, intention, and transformation.</p>

    <p>If you're someone who values authenticity, momentum, and building the future one brave step at a time — we’ll probably get along.</p>
